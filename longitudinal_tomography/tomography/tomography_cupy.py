class TomographyCuPy(TomographyCuPyABC):
    """Class for performing tomographic reconstruction of phase space.

    The tomographic routine largely consists of two parts. Projection and
    back projection. The **back projection** creates a phase space
    reconstruction based on the measured profiles. The **projection**
    routine converts from back projection to reconstructed profiles.

    By comparing the reconstructed profiles to the measured profiles,
    adjustments of the weights can be made in order to create
    a better reconstruction. The number of iterations in this process can be
    specified by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D array of measured profiles, shaped: (nprofiles, nbins).
    x_coords: ndarray
        x-coordinates of particles, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system. Shape: (nparts, nprofiles).

    Attributes
    ----------
    nparts: int
        Number of test particles.
    nprofs: int
        Number of profiles (time frames).
    nbins: int
        Number of bins in each profile.
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D array of measured profiles, shaped: (nprofiles, nbins).
        Negative values of waterfall is set to zero, and the waterfall is
        normalized.
    xp: ndarray
        x-coordinates of particles, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system. Shape: (nparts, nprofiles).
    recreated: ndarray
        Recreated waterfall. Directly comparable with *Tomography.waterfall*.
        Shape: (nprofiles, nbins).
    diff: ndarray
        Discrepancy for phase space reconstruction at each iteration
        of the reconstruction process.

        Performs the full reconstruction using CuPy.

        - The discrepancy of each iteration is saved in the objects\
          **diff** variable.
        - The particles weights are saved in the objects **weight** variable.
        - The reconstructed profiles are saved to the objects\
          **recreated** variable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        niter: int
            Number of iterations in reconstruction.
        verbose: boolean
            Flag to indicate that the status of the tomography should be
            written to stdout. The output is identical to output
            generated in the original Fortran tomography.
        callback: Callable
            Passing a callback with function signature
            (progress: int, total: int) will allow the tracking loop to call
            this function at the end of each turn, allowing the python caller
            to monitor the progress.

        Returns
        -------
        weight: ndarray
            1D array containing the weight of each particle.
