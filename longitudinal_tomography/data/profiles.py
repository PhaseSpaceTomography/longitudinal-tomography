class Profiles:
    """Class holding measured data.

    This class holds the measured data (waterfall) and their properties.

    The waterfall is a nprofiles x nbins shaped array, waterfall[0] is the
    first measurement. Each bin is `Machine.dtbin` long,
    and holds the intensity of the beam at this time of the measurement.

    The profile charge can be provided, or calculated using
    the `Profiles.calc_profilecharge` function which is based
    on the machines pickup sensitivity.

    Also, the class can be used to calculate the self-fields of the bunch
    by calling the `Profiles.calc_self_fields` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        Holds information about the measurements and the machine.
    sampling_time: float
        Original measurement sampling time.
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D-array containing all profile measurements.
    profile_charge: float, optional, default=None
        Total charge of a reference profile.

    Attributes
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        The machine and its settings when measurements was taken.
        This object is needed for assertions, to check that the provided
        waterfall is correct compared to the machine parameters. It is
        also needed for calculating the self fields and profile charge
        of the bunch.
    sampling_time: float
        Original sampling time of measurements.
        Needed for calculation of profile charge.
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D array containing all profile measurements.
        Array should have the shape: (N, M), where N is the number of profiles
        and M is the number of bins of each profile.
    profile_charge: float
        The total charge of a reference profile.
    vself: ndarray, float
        2D array of self-fields at each bin of each profile.
        The shape of the array is (N, W), N is the number of profiles, and
        W is the `Profiles.wrap_length`.
    dsprofiles: ndarray, float
        2D array containing Filtered profiles. Shape should be
        (N, M), where N is the number of profiles
        and M is the number of bins of each profile.
    phiwrap: float
        The phase [rad] covering an integer of rf periods.
    wrap_length: float
        Maximum number of bins to cover an integer number of rf periods.
