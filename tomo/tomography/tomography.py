class Tomography(TomographyABC):
    """Class for performing tomographic reconstruction of phase space.

    The tomographic routine largely consists of two parts. Projection and
    back projection. The **back projection** creates a phase space
    reconstruction based on the measured profiles. The **projection**
    routine converts from back projection to reconstructed profiles.

    By comparing the reconstructed profiles to the measured profiles,
    adjustments of the weights can be made in order to create
    a better reconstruction. The number of iterations in this process can be
    specified by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D array of measured profiles, shaped: (nprofiles, nbins).
    x_coords: ndarray
        x-coordinates of particles, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system. Shape: (nparts, nprofiles).

    Attributes
    ----------
    nparts: int
        Number of test particles.
    nprofs: int
        Number of profiles (time frames).
    nbins: int
        Number of bins in each profile.
    waterfall: ndarray
        2D array of measured profiles, shaped: (nprofiles, nbins).
        Negative values of waterfall is set to zero, and the waterfall is
        normalized.
    xp: ndarray
        x-coordinates of particles, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system. Shape: (nparts, nprofiles).
    recreated: ndarray
        Recreated waterfall. Directly comparable with *Tomography.waterfall*.
        Shape: (nprofiles, nbins).
    diff: ndarray
        Discrepancy for phase space reconstruction at each iteration
        of the reconstruction process.

        The discrepancy of each iteration is saved in the *diff* array

        The recreated waterfall can be found calling the *recreated* field

        Parameters
