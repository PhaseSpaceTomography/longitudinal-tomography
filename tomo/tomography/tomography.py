class TomographyCpp(stmo.Tomography):
    '''Class for performing tomographic reconstruction of phase space.
    
    The tomographic routine largely consists of two parts. Projection and
    back projection. The **back projection** creates a phase space
    reconstruction pased on the measured profiles. The **projection**
    routine converts from back projection to reconstructed profiles.

    By comparing the reconstructed profiles to the measured profiles,
    adjustments of the weights can be made in order to create
    a better reconstruction. The number of iterations in this process can be
    spescified by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    waterfall: ndarray, float
        Measured profiles (nprofiles, nbins).
        Negative values of waterfall is set to zero, and the
        waterfall is normalized as the tomography objects are created.   
    x_coords: ndarray: int
        particles x-coordinates, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system (nparts, nprofiles).

    Attributes
    ----------
    nparts: int
        Number of test particles.
    nprofs: int
        Number of profiles (time frames).
    nbins: int
        Number of bins in each profile.
    waterfall: ndarray, float
        Measured profiles.
    xp: ndarray, int
        particles x-coordinates, given as coordinates of the reconstructed
        phase space coordinate system (nparts, nprofiles).
    recreated: ndarray, float
        Recreated waterfall. Directly comparable with `waterfall`.
    diff: ndarray, float
        Discrepancy for phase space reconstruction at each iteration
        of the reconstruction process.

    def run_hybrid(self, niter=20, verbose=False):
        '''Function to perform tomographic reconstruction, implemented
        as a hybrid between C++ and Python.

        Projection and back projection routines are called from C++,
        the rest is written in python. Kept for reference.

        The discrepancy of each iteration is saved in the `diff` variable
        of the object.

        The recreated waterfall can be found calling the `recreated` field
        of the object. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        niter: int
            number of iterations of reconstruction.
        verbose: boolean
            Flag to indicate that the status of the tomography should be 
            written to stdout. The output is identical to output
            generated in the original Fortran tomography.

        Returns
        -------
        weight: ndarray, float
            Array containing weight of each particle.
