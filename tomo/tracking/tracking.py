class Tracking(ptracker.ParticleTracker):
    '''Class for particle tracking.

    This class is needed in order to perform the particle tracking based on the
    algotithm from the original tomography program. Here, an initial
    distribution of test particles are homogeneously distributed across the
    reconstruction area. Later, these will be tracked trough all machine turns
    and saved for every time frame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        Holds all information needed for particle tracking and generation of
        the particle distribution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        Holds all information needed for particle tracking and generation of
        the particle distribution.
    particles: Particles
        Creates and/or holds initial distribution of particles.
    nturns: int
        Number of machine turns particles should be tracked trough.
    self_field_flag: property, boolean
        Flag to indicate that self-fields should be included during tracking.
    fortran_flag: property, boolean
        Flag to indicate that the particle tracking should print fortran-style
        output strings to stdout during tracking.

    def __init__(self, machine):
        super().__init__(machine)

    def track(self, recprof, init_distr=None):
        '''Primary function for tracking particles.

        The tracking routine starts at a given time frame with an initial
        distribution. From here, the particles are tracked 'forward' towards
        the last time frame and backwards towards the first time frame.
        The initial distribution should be placed on the time frame
        intended to be reconstructed.

        By default, the initial particle distribution will be homogeneously
        distributed over the reconstruction area. This is based on the 
        original Fortran tomography algorithm.
        An user spescified distribution can be given and override the 
        automatic particle generation.

        By calling the :py:meth:`~tomo.tracking.particle_tracker.
        ParticleTracker.enable_self_fields` function, a flag indicating that
        self-fields are to be included in the tracking is set. In this case,
        the :py:meth:`~tomo.tracking.tracking.Tracking.kick_and_drift_self`
        function will be used. Note that tracking including self fields
        are much slower than without.

        By calling the :py:meth:`~tomo.tracking.particle_tracker.
        ParticleTracker.enable_fortran_output` function, output resembling
        the original is written to stdout. Note that the values for the
        number of lost particles are **not valid**. Note also, if 
        the full Fortran output is to be printed, the automatic
        generation of particles has to be performed.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        recprof: int
            Time frame to set as start-profile.
            Here the particle will have its initial distribution.
        init_distr: tuple, (ndarray, ndarray)
            An optional initial distributin. Must be given as a tuple of
            coordinates (dphi, denergy). dphi is the phase difference
            from the synchronous particle [rad]. denergy is the difference
            in energy from the synchronous particle.

        Returns
        -------
        xp: ndarray, float
            2D array containing each particles x-coordinate at
            each time frame. Array shape: (nprofiles, nparts).

            * If self-fields are enabeled,
              the coordinates will be given as phase-space coordinates.
            * If not, the returned x-coordinates will be given as
              phase [rad] relative to the synchronous particle.

        yp: ndarray, float
            2D array containing each particles y-coordinate at
            each time frame. Array shape: (nprofiles, nparts).

            * If self-fields are enabeled,
              the coordinates will be given as phase-space coordinates.
            * If not, the returned y-coordinates will be given as
              energy [eV] relative to the synchronous particle.
