class ParticleTracker:
    '''Super class for tracking classes.
    
    The particle class holds some general utilities por particle tracking.
    These includes asserions of parameters and properties for flags.

    Parameters
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        Holds all information needed for particle tracking and generation of
        the particle distribution.

    Attributes
    ----------
    machine: Machine
        Holds all information needed for particle tracking and generation of
        the particle distribution.
    particles: Particles
        Creates and/or holds initial distribution of particles.
    nturns: int
        Number of machine turns particles should be tracked trough.
    self_field_flag: property, boolean
        Flag to indicate that self-fields should be included during tracking.
    fortran_flag: property, boolean
        Flag to indicate that the particle tracking should print fortran-style
        output strings to stdout during tracking.

    Raises
    ------
    MachineParameterError: Exception
        Input argument is not of type Machine, or Machine object\
        fields needed for tracking are missing.

        Returns
        -------
        self_field_flag: boolean
            Flag to indicate that self-fields are to be used during tracking.

            Flag to indicate that Fortran styled output is enabeled.

        return self._ftn_flag

    def enable_fortran_output(self, profile_charge):
        '''Function for enabeling of Fortran-styled output.
        
        Call this function in order to produce a Fortran-styled\
        output during the particle tracking. The output will be\
        printed to stdout.

        The output will initially be a print of the plot info needed for\
        the tomoscope application. During the tracking, the output will
        describe between which profiles the particles are currently\
        being tracked between. Also, the number of 'lost particles' will be\
        printed. This is however **not a real measurement**,\
        but a static string needed due to changes in the tracking algorithm. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        profile_charge: float
            Total charge of profile.

        Raises
        ------
        ProfileChargeNotCalculated: Exception
            Needed field for enabeling Fortran output,\
            profile charge, is missing from Machine object.

        '''Function for enabeling particle tracking using self-fields.

        Call this function to track the particles using self-fields.
        Note that the self-field tracking is **much slower** than\
        tracking without self-fields. 

        Parameters
        ----------
        profiles: Profiles
            Self-field calculations must have been performed in\
            the Profiles object prior to calling this function.

        ------
